Working in [Ofertorio](https://github.com/ofertorio) project.

- 👨‍💻 Currently playing with JavaScript/TypeScript, PHP, Java, C# and a little bit of Assembly. 
- 🔭 Working @ [TechTail](https://github.com/techtail) as dev ops, fullstack coder, security engineer and microsservices manager.

- 🤔 Some cool and/or interesting facts:
  - ⛏💎 I've made a functional Node.js Minecraft server for version 1.16 in the past, but it never saw the sunlight rise.
